        <h1><span class="">The Cat in the Hat</span></h1>
        <p>
            <span class="">The sun did not shine.</span><br>
            <span class="">It was too wet to play.</span><br>
            <span class="">So we sat in the house</span><br>
            <span class="">All that cold, cold, wet day.</span></p>
        <p><span class="">I sat there with Sally.</span><br><span class="">
                We sat there, we two.</span><br><span class="">
                And I said, “How I wish</span><br><span class="">
                We had something to do!”</span></p>
        <p><span class="">Too wet to go out</span><br><span class="">
                And too cold to play ball.</span><br><span class="">
                So we sat in the house.</span><br><span class="">
                We did nothing at all.</span></p>
        <p><span class="">So all we could do was to</span><br><span class="">
                Sit! </span><span class="">Sit! </span><span class="">Sit! </span><span class="">Sit!</span></p>
        <p><span class="">And we did not like it.</span><br><span class="">
                Not one little bit.</span></p>
        <p><span class="">And then</span><br><span class="">
                Something went BUMP!</span><br><span class="">
                How that bump made us jump!</span></p>
        <p><span class="">We looked!</span><br><span class="">
                Then we saw him step in on the mat!</span><br><span class="">
                We looked!</span><br><span class="">
                And we saw him!</span><br><span class="">
                The Cat in the Hat!</span><br><span class="">
                And he said to us,</span><br><span class="">
                “Why do you sit there like that?”</span></p>
        <p><span class="">“I know it is wet</span><br><span class="">
                And the sun is not sunny.</span><br><span class="">
                But we can have</span><br><span class="">
                Lots of good fun that is funny!”</span></p>
        <p><span class="">“I know some good games we could play,”</span><br><span class="">
                Said the cat.</span><br><span class="">
                “I know some new tricks,”</span><br><span class="">
                Said the Cat in the Hat.</span><br><span class="">
                “A lot of good tricks.</span><br><span class="">
                I will show them to you.</span><br><span class="">
                Your mother</span><br><span class="">
                Will not mind at all if I do.”</span></p>
        <p><span class="">Then Sally and I</span><br><span class="">
                Did not know what to say.</span><br><span class="">
                Our mother was out of the house</span><br><span class="">
                For the day.</span></p>
        <p><span class="">But our fish said, “No! </span><span class="">No!</span><br><span class="">
                Make that cat go away!</span><br><span class="">
                Tell that Cat in the Hat</span><br><span class="">
                You do NOT want to play.</span><br><span class="">
                He should not be here.</span><br><span class="">
                He should not be about.</span><br><span class="">
                He should not be here</span><br><span class="">
                When your mother is out!”</span></p>
        <p><span class="">“Now! </span><span class="">Now! </span><span class="">Have no fear.</span><br><span class="">
                Have no fear!” said the cat.</span><br><span class="">
                “My tricks are not bad,”</span><br><span class="">
                Said the Cat in the Hat.</span><br><span class="">
                “Why, we can have</span><br><span class="">
                Lots of good fun, if you wish,</span><br><span class="">
                With a game that I call</span><br><span class="">
                UP-UP-UP with a fish!”</span></p>
        <p><span class="">“Put me down!” said the fish.</span><br><span class="">
                “This is no fun at all!</span><br><span class="">
                Put me don!” said the fish.</span><br><span class="">
                “I do NOT wish to fall!”</span></p>
        <p><span class="">“Have no fear!” said the cat.</span><br><span class="">
                “I will not let you fall.</span><br><span class="">
                I will hold you up high</span><br><span class="">
                As I stand on a ball.</span><br><span class="">
                With a book on one hand!</span><br><span class="">
                And a cup on my hat!</span><br><span class="">
                But that is not ALL I can do!’</span><br><span class="">
                Said the cat…</span></p>
